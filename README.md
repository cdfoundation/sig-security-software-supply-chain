# Software Supply Chain Working Group

[//]: # '## Quick links'


## Objective

The Software Supply Chain Working Group provides a neutral home for discussion, design, and adoption of an industry [framework](framework.md) for software supply chain security.

## Mission

Participants across the software supply chain (developers, packagers, application and service providers, and end customers) can produce and consume trustworthy software.


[//]: # "# Governance"

[//]: # "[SIG-Security charter](governance/charter.md) outlines the scope  of our group activities, as part of our [governance process](governance) which details how we work."
